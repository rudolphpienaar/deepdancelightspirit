<h3>Lara Seven</h3>

<p>
With hindsight I can appreciate the circuitous journey towards dance that my life has followed. ¬†As a young person I studied flamenco for eight years... and I hated every minute of it. When I looked into the studio mirror I only saw a girl who was not graceful enough, who couldn‚Äôt follow the beat, who couldn‚Äôt remember the steps. The day I said ‚ÄúNo more!‚Äù still counts as one of the most liberating days of my life. ¬†
</p><p>
It was only later in my twenties that I began to appreciate the sense of fluidity and rhythm that my training had given me. I started to dance by myself for the joy and release of it. It felt easy and intuitive to dance my heart out. I felt that my body and my spirit connected through dance. 
</p><p>
In my thirties circumstances tore at me to such an extent that I lost touch with the spiritual side of myself, and I began to dance less frequently, feeling that I couldn‚Äôt dance--that when I did, it was too painful to bear.
</p><p>
A wise woman told me once that nothing precious is ever truly lost and I held onto that sentence for dear life. ¬†I had changed my name thinking that perhaps my life would be clearer and easier if I was known as Claire. ¬†As the years passed by I started to be drawn to dance again and I looked for a place where I could dance wildly and freely, in communion with myself and others, and so be healed. ¬†I now know there are modalities out there that offer a degree of what I was looking for but I never found exactly what my heart and body and spirit wanted. I am grateful now for the way that those experiences did not give me what I needed because Deep Dance Light Spirit might never have come into existence had it not been for those experiences. 
</p><p>
After I realized that I wanted to do this work it still took a long time to give myself permission to go ahead. It was only after two deeply transformative journeys that I realized that ¬†I am my own perfect instrument and my life with all of its many complexities, challenges, and suffering, together with my long, wide, and deep search for spiritual and psychological truth set me on this path and had served to prepare me for this work. I did not reach this point alone. I had the guidance and love of a handful of very dear and wise people. When I think of them my heart overflows with gratitude.
</p><p>
My aim is to be an instrument for the Divine Creative so that it may flow through the music into every dancer, that they may dance away the things that weigh them down, the things that cause them to stumble, and in so doing that they may open up to the the perfect, loving, creative and radiant beings that they are.
</p>



<h3>Deep Dance Light Spirit</h3>
<p>
We all intuitively understand that music has the power to move us. In Deep Dance Light Spirit we use evocative (which literally means "to call forth") music to summon our feelings--our emotions. If we give them permission, emotions become energy in motion. When we open up to what is present in the moment, we see that our feelings want us to dance them. And if we dance them, old wounds heal, knots loosen, we shake off heaviness, despair lifts, sadness flows away and we begin to feel our joy rise right from our tippy toes to our fingers and all the way up through the tops of our heads. We feel exhilarated, happy, clear, purposeful and finally at peace.
</p>
<p>
Through skillful facilitation and careful selection of music we undertake transformative journeys into our deep selves. We do this together in community because we are not disembodied spirits wandering the earth alone. We honor the need for connection because it is through connection that we learn about the world, other people, and ultimately ourselves. We dance in a large group, alone, in small groups and one on one. We dance in safety and in sacred space. No previous dancing experience is necessary--everyone can dance their life.
</p>
<p>
In Deep Dance Light Spirit we have large doses of fun at the same time as intense physical, emotional and spiritual work(ing)-outs.
