<h2><a href="#">about... </a></h2>

<p>
We all intuitively understand that music has the power to move us. In Deep Dance Light Spirit we use evocative (which literally means "to call forth") music to summon our feelings--our emotions. If we give them permission, emotions become energy in motion. When we open up to what is present in the moment, we see that our feelings want us to dance them. And if we dance them, old wounds heal, knots loosen, we shake off heaviness, despair lifts, sadness flows away and we begin to feel our joy rise right from our tippy toes to our fingers and all the way up through the tops of our heads. We feel exhilarated, happy, clear, purposeful and finally at peace.
</p>
<p>
Through skillful facilitation and careful selection of music we undertake transformative journeys into our deep selves. We do this together in community because we are not disembodied spirits wandering the earth alone. We honor the need for connection because it is through connection that we learn about the world, other people, and ultimately ourselves. We dance in a large group, alone, in small groups and one on one. We dance in safety and in sacred space. No previous dancing experience is necessary--everyone can dance their life.
</p>
<p>
In Deep Dance Light Spirit we have large doses of fun at the same time as intense physical, emotional and spiritual work(ing)-outs.
